The Relay project here at Google Code has been taken over by [Jim Salter of JRS Systems](http://jrs-s.net/).

Relay v1.5.3 is released and available from the Downloads page, featuring improved UI and GREATLY improved performance for large filesets.  Relay also now gracefully handles files and directories inserted into its filestore by other means than upload through Relay itself - so, for example, you can use FTP, Samba, etc. as alternate means of managing files inside the filestore.
